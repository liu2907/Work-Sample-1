Generally speaking, higher total scores represent higher candidate potential, and candidates that get a score of 56 or higher have significantly higher performance.</p><p>However, there may be some concerning responses (e.g., red flag interview answers) or results (e.g., an average rating of 1 for writing quality) that are disguised by the total score, due to high ratings on other competencies. In those cases, the total score may not reflect important nuances that should be considered. This means that, although candidates can and should be broadly compared on total scores, it is important to not overlook finer distinctions that may affect the candidate’s performance potential.</p><p>In addition to this, the candidate’s ability to meet core job requirements (e.g., related to work travel, being on call, attending training, possessing a valid driver’s license, or passing a criminal background check or pre-employment drug screening) should be factored in to hiring decisions.</p>",

        "body": "<p>The lowest possible total score is -80 and the maximum possible total score is 80. Hiring panels and selecting officials are encouraged to use the total candidate score as a decision guide, while factoring in scores on individual competencies. Generally speaking, higher total scores are, on average, associated with better performance. More specifically, candidates who score higher than 56 are almost 6 times as likely to have higher-than-average job performance than those who score below 56. &nbsp;</p><p>It’s important to understand that this result is on average, across candidates. A score is not a perfect predictor for any one candidate. Some high scorers may not ultimately have higher performance, and some low scorers may have had or may have higher performance. Just like when it comes to assessing children and families, no assessment is going to perfectly predict what a person will do or how things will go in the future. We use our assessments to make predictions based on what we know is likely to be true across people. For this reason and others, there will be no strict cutoff scores that must be followed. Hiring panels are encouraged to use the total score as a decision guide, leaving room for other factors and circumstances to be taken into account as needed.</p><p>One potential issue is concerning responses (e.g., red flag interview answers) or results (e.g., an average rating of 1 for writing quality) that are disguised by the total score (due to high ratings on other competencies). In those cases, the total score may not reflect important nuances that should be considered. So although candidates can and should be broadly compared on total scores, it is important to not overlook finer distinctions that may affect the candidate’s performance potential. In addition, the candidate’s ability to meet core job requirements (e.g., related to work travel, being on call, attending training, possessing a valid driver’s license, or passing a criminal background check or pre-employment drug screening) should be factored into hiring decisions. Though the total score is very informative, it is only part of the picture when making a hiring decision.</p>",

    "body": "<p>A steering committee, composed of representatives from Child Welfare Services and its partners, was convened to provide guidance for the work. An examination of hiring practices across the state showed that there were over 250 different interview questions in use or available for use. Some offices assessed candidates’ typing or writing skills, and some had other questionnaires or forms to gather candidate information. All of these variations resulted in inconsistent processes across the agency. Though some interview questions were good and followed best practices, many were not optimal for identifying candidate potential, and some even posed legal risks. Candidates’ responses were often rated, but there was no guidance regarding appropriate ratings for different responses. Finally, there was no information available on the extent to which the hiring process led to effective hiring decisions.</p>",
